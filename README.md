Solar radiation is often defined as the energy reaching the earth from the sun.

People have been measuring the energy coming from the sun for centuries, and today more people are measuring solar radiation than ever before.

But we are still in need of an efficient and accurate way of measuring solar radiation.

The solar radiation is dependent on Humidity and Temperature.
Measuring solar radiation using different devices requires a lot of manpower and resources.

It takes a lot of time fixing the sensors and interpreting the readings from the different devices which becomes inefficient as time goes by.

The company has hired you as data science consultants. They want to automate the process of predicting the compressive strength of the concrete, based on the materials used.<br>

Solar radiation is measured by its energy power transferred per unit area (watts / m 2). In general, the Earth receives less than 0.5 × 10 −9 of the energy of its radiation from the Sun. The functional unit that describes solar radiation reaching Earth is solar irradiance, or unit of power per square meter (w / m²). See more
##<center><font color="Deep Blue">**3.About the Dataset**</font></center>
The **dataset** contains **4 months** of the **measurements.**

The data comes directly from NASA’s weather research lab based on actual reading taken by their sensors situated at different locations.

This is the data that we have to predict for future samples.

The dataset is divided into two parts: Train and Test sets.

**Train Set:**
The train set contains 26148 rows and 12 columns.
The last column Radiation is the target variable.

**Test Set:**
The test set contains 6538 rows and 11 columns.
The test set doesn’t contain the Radiation column.
It needs to be predicted for the test set.

**Sample Submission File:**
A sample submission csv file named sample_submission.csv is also provided with the dataset.
This sample submission file contains the format of the final predictions submission csv file that you need to upload via the Upload Submission tab.

**Dataset Download Link**
The dataset can be downloaded from this
